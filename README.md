# CO-and-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions
Climate change is a critical global challenge, and one of its major drivers is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO₂). This project uses historical emissions data to build regression models that can help analyze and predict trends in CO₂ and GHG outputs across different countries.
